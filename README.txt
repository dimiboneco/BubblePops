THINGS I IMPLEMENTED:

3 sorts of bubbles implemented: array with bubbles, playable bubble, next playable bubble.
Bubbles with the same power of 2 merge to a new bubble whose number is the next power of 2.
If two bubbles with number 1024 merge, the neighbour bubbles are also destroyed.
A start menu is available.
The following buttons are available: pause, resume and restart the game.
A touch input is implemented.
An explosion animation occurs if 2 bubbles with number 1024 merge, destroying their neighbour bubbles.
A background music and a short sound clip that plays during merging are added.
Score
When the board is cleared, the message "PERFECT!!!" appears.

THINGS THAT DON'T WORK WELL:
  
Bubble/group of bubbles that do not hang from the ceiling must fall.
If the bubble after the merge can further merge with other bubbles, this doesn't work.
Sometimes 2 bubbles may merge, even though there is one bubble between them, due to the fact that they belong to the same neighbour (the bubble between them).

COPYRIGHT ISSUES:

I got the sound clips and the explosion animation from the UDEMY courses that I attended. They were provided to the people who buy the course as part of the learning program.
I got the pause, resume and restart buttons from the assets store and internet.
